# Product Requirements Document: Sephora Ingredient Analysis Tool

## Introduction/Overview
The Sephora Ingredient Analysis Tool is a web application that helps environmentally conscious consumers make informed decisions about beauty products by analyzing their ingredients. The tool searches Sephora.com for products, extracts their ingredient lists, and provides a detailed breakdown of natural vs. synthetic ingredients using LLM-based classification.

## Goals
1. Enable users to quickly understand the composition of beauty products
2. Provide accurate ingredient classification (natural vs. synthetic)
3. Help users make more environmentally conscious purchasing decisions
4. Deliver results in a clear, easy-to-understand format

## User Stories
1. As an environmentally conscious consumer, I want to search for a beauty product on Sephora so that I can understand its ingredient composition
2. As a user, I want to see a detailed breakdown of natural vs. synthetic ingredients so that I can make informed purchasing decisions
3. As a user, I want to understand the environmental impact of ingredients so that I can choose more sustainable products

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must allow users to search for products on Sephora.com using a search term
2. The system must extract and display the complete ingredient list for the searched product
3. The system must classify each ingredient as natural, synthetic, or derived from natural sources
4. The system must calculate and display the percentage of natural vs. synthetic ingredients
5. The system must provide a detailed breakdown of each ingredient with its classification
6. The system must include environmental impact information for ingredients where available
7. The system must handle cases where ingredient information is not available
8. The system must provide clear error messages when products cannot be found

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Storing search history
2. Saving favorite products
3. Including price information
4. Exporting results to other formats
5. Batch processing multiple products
6. User accounts or authentication

## Design Considerations
1. Clean, minimalist web interface using React
2. Clear visual representation of natural vs. synthetic percentages
3. Easy-to-read ingredient breakdown
4. Mobile-responsive design
5. Clear loading states and error messages

## Technical Considerations
1. Frontend:
   - React for the user interface
   - Modern UI components for data visualization
   - Responsive design principles

2. Backend:
   - Express.js server
   - Web scraping functionality for Sephora.com
   - Integration with LLM for ingredient classification
   - API endpoints for product search and analysis

3. Data Processing:
   - LLM-based ingredient classification system
   - Percentage calculation logic
   - Environmental impact assessment

## Success Metrics
1. Accuracy of ingredient classification (target: >90% accuracy)
2. User satisfaction with the clarity of information presented
3. System response time for searches and analysis
4. Successful extraction of ingredient lists from Sephora.com

## Open Questions
1. What specific LLM model will be used for ingredient classification?
2. How will we handle rate limiting from Sephora.com?
3. What is the expected volume of concurrent users?
4. How will we validate the accuracy of the LLM classifications?

## Implementation Phases
1. Phase 1: Basic product search and ingredient extraction
2. Phase 2: LLM integration for ingredient classification
3. Phase 3: Environmental impact analysis
4. Phase 4: UI/UX refinement and testing
